# hello-world

This is my first "contribution" to the community. I signed up to expose myself and broadly learn about coding, data science, data analytics, programming and everything that it covers. Neither am I a professional in this field, nor do I major in a related subject. 
I expect these topics to slowly immerse themselves not only in business, but also in everyday life. Hence, general knowledge about these topics seemingly becomes an equivalent of basic literacy. 
To me it is of paramount importance to participate and contribute to the community I grew up in, and hopefully also soon the github community, business-wise as much as in private live. 

Only if you are able to read and write, you are able to grow, learn, communicate, and interact with the world and achieve your aims.

Creating a sustainable future with solid perspectives for everyone, is my ultimate goal.
This I plan to do today and in the decades to come.
