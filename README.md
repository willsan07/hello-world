# hello-world

This is my first "contribution" to the community. My aim is to expose myself to and broadly learn about coding, data science, data analytics, programming and everything that it covers. Neither am I a professional in this field, nor do I major in a related subject. 
I expect these topics to slowly immerse themselves not only in business, but also in everyday life. Hence, general knowledge (the more the better) about these topics seemingly becomes a new form of basic literacy. 
To me it is of paramount importance to participate and contribute to the community I grew up in, and hopefully also soon the github community, business-wise as much as in private live. 
This I plan today and in the decades to come.
